# Breakout
The classic game of breakout!
Created using the Stanford Java Library on Eclipse. The game features a paddle, bricks, and a ball which are all created using GObjects. The paddle is moved by tracing the x-coordinates of the mouse. The main challenge of this program was being able to tell when an object collides with another, which object it was, and what the object does subsequently.  Bricks are destroyed when a ball collides with a brick. The ball must not hit the bottom of the screen or else a turn is lost. When the player gets to 0 turns, they lose. Clear all of the bricks to win.
